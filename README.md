# Rupee Collector
In this application I created a guessing game using bootstrap for the html and jQuery for the behavior.

## Instructions
* You will be given a random number at the start of the game.
* There are four Rupees below, each with a random number value between 1-12 assigned to them.
* When you click each rupee it will add the value of it to you score.
* The objective of the game is match the exact value of the given random number in order to win.
* If you match the random number then you win and it adjusts your score. 
* If your score goes over the random number then you lose.
* Score is kept until the page is refreshed.
